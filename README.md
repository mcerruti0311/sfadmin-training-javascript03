## JavaScript training hour 3

#### What You’ll Learn in This Hour:

* How to define functions
* How to call (execute) functions
* How functions receive data
* Returning values from functions
* About the scope of variables

### Using Functions
Commonly, programs carry out the same or similar tasks repeatedly during the course of their execution. For you to avoid rewriting the same piece of code over and over again, JavaScript has the means to parcel up parts of your code into reusable modules, called functions. Once you’ve written a function, it is available for the rest of your program to use, as if it were itself a part of the JavaScript language.

Using functions also makes your code easier to debug and maintain. Suppose you’ve written an application to calculate shipping costs; when the tax rates or haulage prices change, you’ll need to make changes to your script. There may be 50 places in your code where such calculations are carried out. When you attempt to change every calculation, you’re likely to miss some instances or introduce errors. However, if all such calculations are wrapped up in a few functions used throughout the application, then you just need to make changes to those functions. Your changes will automatically be applied all through the application.

Functions are one of the basic building blocks of JavaScript and will appear in virtually every script you write. In this hour you see how to create and use functions.
